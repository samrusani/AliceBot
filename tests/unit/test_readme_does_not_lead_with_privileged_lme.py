"""README must not lead with the privileged LongMemEval number as current product.

81.2% is a v0.12.0 store_chunks receipt. The badge and the first LongMemEval
paragraph used to present it as the product path. The named mutation is
restoring the old ``LongMemEval_s-81.2% (3-run mean)`` badge as the lead
claim. That change must fail this test.
