# Rules

## State Discipline
- Treat Phases 9-13 and Bridge `B1` through `B4` as shipped baseline truth.
- Treat `v0.4.0` as released baseline truth.
- Keep shipped baseline, active phase scope, and later roadmap scope separate.
- Keep [CURRENT_STATE.md](CURRENT_STATE.md) factual/current and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) future-facing.
- Keep [.ai/handoff/CURRENT_STATE.md](.ai/handoff/CURRENT_STATE.md) as the canonical handoff copy when duplicate current-state files exist.

## Phase 14 Rule
- Phase 14 is a platform-and-adoption phase. Prioritize provider adapters, model packs, reference integrations, and design partner onboarding. Do not allow scope drift into new substrate research, new channels, or enterprise governance work unless required by a declared Phase 14 deliverable.

## Provider Rules
- Continuity semantics must not fork by provider.
- A provider may change capability support, latency, token budgets, and model-specific quirks.
- A provider must not change the continuity object model, contradiction handling, provenance contracts, trust semantics, or one-call continuity behavior.
- Provider capability discovery and invocation telemetry should be first-class, persisted, and inspectable.
- Do not reopen provider-foundation work redundantly after `P14-S1`; follow-on provider sprints must be about contract alignment, compatibility proof, or a newly declared provider class.

## Model Pack Rules
- Model packs are declarative, versioned profiles, not forks.
- Packs may shape prompt/context behavior, tool strategy, briefing strategy, and runtime defaults.
- Packs must not invent a second continuity model or bypass trust/provenance rules.
- Ship only first-party packs for major families first; everything else waits.

## Integration Rules
- For Hermes, use provider hooks for automation and MCP for explicit deep actions.
- Keep MCP fallback viable even when provider or bridge integrations are the recommended mode.
- Reference integrations must be runnable and documented, not aspirational.
- Generic Python and TypeScript integration examples are in-scope platform proof, not optional extras.

## Design Partner Rules
- Design partners are tracked product proof, not ad hoc support conversations.
- Capture onboarding, pilot status, usage summaries, and structured feedback explicitly.
- Choose small, opinionated pilot scopes over broad custom engagements.

## Docs And Operations Rules
- Docs are sprint deliverables, not cleanup work.
- Provider docs, model-pack docs, integration docs, and onboarding docs must stay aligned to shipped behavior.
- Runnable docs/examples and demo helpers should use a shared canonical fixture or the real contract surface, not an ad hoc inline mock payload.
- Acceptance dashboards must derive readiness from persisted evidence that matches the acceptance criteria, not from proxy signals such as linkage alone.
- Canonical launch-set and rollout docs may use anonymized partner identifiers, but placeholders/examples must be labeled as such and must not be used as sprint-completion evidence.
- Keep credentials, tokens, and secret references out of logs, docs, and outward-facing errors.
- Any new workspace-scoped hosted table must ship with row-level security enablement, workspace access policies, and a regression test for that access posture.
- Keep local filesystem paths, workstation usernames, and machine-specific identifiers out of committed docs and reports.
- Keep consequential side effects approval-bounded.
- Commit public evidence only from exact commands and stable fixtures, never from inferred pass states.

## Scope Rules
- Do not widen Phase 14 into retrieval research, graph migration, new channels, marketplace work, enterprise governance expansion, major vertical-agent work, or deep browser/action automation unless explicitly re-scoped.
- Do not silently hardcode unresolved Control Tower decisions as permanent runtime behavior without recording the decision.
- Surface underspecified decisions as Control Tower decisions instead of inventing scope.
