"""Repair retry/confirmation identifiers 0083 stranded on tombstones.

Revision 20260711_0083 made ``commit_digest`` and ``confirmation_id`` unique by
keeping the *earliest* duplicate as the canonical lookup target. It ordered the
duplicates purely by ``created_at``/``id`` and never considered deletion, so an
older archived/deleted row (a tombstone) would win the identifier while a newer
active row was cleared. The runtime replay lookups
(``get_memory_by_commit_digest`` / ``get_memory_by_confirmation_id``) filter
``deleted_at IS NULL``, so a stranded identifier makes replay return nothing
while the partial unique index still blocks re-inserting the same key — an
idempotency key or confirmation id that can neither be found nor reused.

0083 already shipped in v0.9.2, and Alembic replays revisions by id rather than
by body, so editing 0083 in place would not re-run on databases that already
applied it. This corrective follow-up therefore repairs the data instead. It is
safe on both populations: a database already mis-upgraded by 0083 is repaired
here, and a database upgrading fresh runs 0083 (which may strand an identifier)
immediately followed by this revision (which moves it back). The pass is
idempotent — on already-correct data it matches no rows.

For every deleted row that still holds an identifier whose cleared sibling (the
one 0083 back-pointed at it via ``metadata_json.lifecycle_migration``) is live,
the identifier is released from the tombstone and restored onto the oldest such
live row. The move is release-then-restore across two statements so the partial
unique index — already in place from 0083 — is never momentarily violated. The
live row is also given back its mirrored ``agentic_memory`` metadata value so it
is indistinguishable from a row a correct 0083 would have left canonical.

Downgrade is intentionally a no-op: this revision only corrects data (no schema
change), and reversing it would re-strand identifiers on tombstones, i.e.
re-introduce the defect. This also keeps the revision safe to re-run.
