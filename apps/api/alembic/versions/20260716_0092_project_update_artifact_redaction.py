"""Make project-update memory redaction cover every persisted coupled copy.

Revision ID: 20260716_0092
Revises: 20260715_0091

True redaction remains an exceptional, marker-shaped UPDATE path.  This
migration extends that path to terminal project-update artifacts, their
quality ratings, and provenance quotes.  It also tightens the existing event
and revision exceptions so only the exact content-free skeleton emitted by
the store is admissible.  Ordinary mutation remains unchanged and RLS still
binds every affected row to ``app.current_user_id()``.
