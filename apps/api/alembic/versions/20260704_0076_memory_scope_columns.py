"""Real multi-scope memory: first-class scope columns on memories.

Until now the only hard scope was ``user_id`` (RLS/binding); project scope
lived as soft metadata (``metadata_json ->> 'project_id'``) and agent
attribution only inside the agentic-commit metadata block. This migration
promotes those scopes to real, filterable columns:

* ``memories.project_id text NULL`` -- backfilled from
  ``metadata_json ->> 'project_id'`` (the key the capture/read paths already
  use for the soft project filter).
* ``memories.created_by_agent_id text NULL`` -- backfilled from the
  agentic-commit metadata written by
  ``vnext_memory_commit.VNextMemoryCommitService._base_metadata`` /
  ``vnext_agent_control.agent_metadata``: the top-level
  ``metadata_json ->> 'agent_id'`` key, falling back to the nested
  ``metadata_json #>> '{agentic_memory,agent_identity,agent_id}'`` key.
* ``memories.run_id text NULL`` -- backfilled the same way from
  ``metadata_json ->> 'agent_run_id'`` falling back to
  ``metadata_json #>> '{agentic_memory,agent_identity,agent_run_id}'``.
  run_id stays metadata-plus-filter only: there is deliberately no session
  entity or foreign key behind it.

A partial index on ``(user_id, project_id) WHERE project_id IS NOT NULL``
backs project-scoped retrieval without taxing unscoped rows.

The trust side of project scoping lands in the same revision:
``agent_api_keys.project_scope text NULL`` binds an issued key to one
project so ``resolve_agent_identity`` can stop trusting the payload's
self-asserted ``project_scope`` whenever a binding exists.

Reversible: the downgrade drops the index and all four columns.
