"""Enforce unique memory retry and confirmation identifiers.

The original semantic-retrieval migration added partial lookup indexes for
``commit_digest`` and ``confirmation_id`` but did not make them unique. Two
concurrent retries could therefore create more than one replay target, and a
reused idempotency key with different content could silently return the first
row.

This revision also closes the last legacy project-scope compatibility gap.
Early agentic commits stored scope only at
``metadata_json.agentic_memory.project_scope``.  When the canonical top-level
``metadata_json.project_scope`` key is absent, the upgrade normalizes that
legacy array into the canonical location and fills ``project_id`` only for an
unambiguous singleton scope.  A present canonical key is authoritative even
when its value is empty, JSON null, or malformed; stale nested scope must not
overwrite it or populate ``project_id``.  Multi-project legacy rows remain
metadata scoped and keep ``project_id`` NULL.  Downgrade deliberately retains
canonical metadata copies created from absent keys because it cannot identify
them later without risking data loss.

Upgrade posture for pre-existing duplicates is lossless for memory content:
the earliest row remains the canonical lookup target, later rows retain their
content/history but relinquish the ambiguous identifier, and their metadata
records the canonical row id. New partial UNIQUE indexes make the invariant
atomic for future writes. Downgrade restores non-unique indexes; it does not
re-introduce identifiers removed from ambiguous duplicate rows.
