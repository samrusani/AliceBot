"""Temporal cheap slice: supersession pointer columns and edge event time.

Answering "what did I believe before / what changed" without the legacy
engine needs two things the vNext schema recorded only softly:

* Memory supersession pointers lived in ``metadata_json``
  (``metadata_json ->> 'superseded_by'`` on the retired row and
  ``metadata_json ->> 'supersedes'`` on its replacement, written by the
  SQLite-mode supersede-existing review flow) while beliefs already had a
  real ``superseded_by`` column. This migration promotes both pointers to
  real columns on ``memories``:

  - ``memories.superseded_by uuid NULL`` -- the memory that replaced this
    row.
  - ``memories.supersedes uuid NULL`` -- the memory this row replaced.

  Both are plain nullable uuid columns with NO foreign key on purpose: a
  supersession pointer is a historical annotation, not a lifecycle
  dependency. An FK to ``memories.id`` would couple delete order (a
  replacement row could not be hard-deleted or archived before its
  predecessor's pointer was cleared, and vice versa) and would break the
  undo/redo paths that retire either side independently. A dangling
  pointer simply ends the supersession chain walk.

* ``graph_edges.observed_at timestamptz NULL`` -- the event time of the
  observation an edge encodes (the source's ``source_created_at``, falling
  back to ``captured_at``, falling back to write time), as opposed to
  ``created_at`` which is purely ingestion time. The write path also
  starts populating the previously dead ``valid_from`` column with the
  same instant, which is what makes as-of edge queries possible.

Backfill: ``superseded_by``/``supersedes`` are copied from the exact
``metadata_json`` keys the review flow writes, guarded by a uuid-shape
match so a malformed metadata value cannot fail the cast; the metadata
copies are kept for backward compatibility. Existing edges keep NULL
``observed_at``/``valid_from`` (their event time was never recorded).

A partial index on ``(user_id, superseded_by) WHERE superseded_by IS NOT
NULL`` backs "what replaced X" lookups without taxing the (vast) majority
of never-superseded rows.

Reversible: the downgrade drops the index and all three columns.
