"""Repair stale lifecycle pointers left in duplicate groups of three or more.

The published 20260712_0084 revision moves retry and confirmation identifiers
from a deleted canonical holder to the oldest live duplicate.  In a group of
three or more, however, later duplicate rows still point at the deleted holder
instead of the live row that now owns the identifier.  Existing v0.9.4
databases are already stamped at 0084, so this delta must live in a new
revision rather than changing the published migration in place.

For each identifier, this revision follows the two-hop repair trail written by
0083/0084 (sibling -> deleted former holder -> live current holder) and rewrites
the sibling pointer to the current holder.  Once rewritten the two-hop pattern
no longer matches, making the pass idempotent.  Downgrade is intentionally a
no-op because restoring stale pointers would reintroduce the defect.
