"""The single source of truth for legal memory lifecycle transitions.

Every lifecycle mutation -- inline confirmation, dashboard review,
correction, undo, forget, expiration, unexpiration, and consolidation
supersession -- routes through :func:`resolve_transition` here, on every
backend and interface (HTTP, MCP, SQLite review path). The table rejects
transitions that were previously reachable and corrupt the store:

* confirming or rejecting a row that a review already retired
  (``rejected`` / ``superseded``), which either resurrected an impossible
  state or produced two active contradictory memories;
* correcting / undoing / forgetting an already-retired row (retirement is
  terminal and must not be reversible);
* unexpiring a ``stale`` row without restoring it to a retrievable state.

Supersession cycles (A -> B -> A) cannot be expressed as a status rule --
they are a property of the pointer graph -- so :func:`supersession_would_cycle`
guards those separately.

This module deliberately imports nothing from ``vnext_memory_commit`` so it
can be shared by the commit service, the MCP review path, and the HTTP
surface without an import cycle.
